# Docker_intro

Create a github repo with a readme on how to set up docker, and 
what is docker benefits etc. , what is the microservices architecture, differences between
microservices and monolith architecture, differences between vm and docker. Tomorrow standup 9:30, do this before then

## What is Docker

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, 
executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

Docker images contain all the dependencies needed to execute code inside a container, so containers that move between Docker environments with the same OS work with no changes. 
Docker uses resource isolation in the OS kernel to run multiple containers on the same OS.

Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. 
Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels
